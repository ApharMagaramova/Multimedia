            <h2>What is animation? </h2>
            <p class="w1">
                Animation is a method of photographing successive drawings, models, or even puppets,
                to create an illusion of movement in a sequence. Because our eyes can only retain an image
                for approx. 1/10 of a second, when multiple images appear in fast succession, the brain blends
                them into a single moving image.

                In traditional animation, pictures are drawn or painted on transparent celluloid sheets to be
                photographed. Early cartoons are examples of this, but today, most animated movies are made with
                computer-generated imagery or CGI.

            <h2>What is 3D animation?</h2>
            <p class="w3">
                Computer 3D animation refers to the work of creating moving pictures in a digital
                environment that is three-dimensional. Through the careful manipulation of objects (3D models)
                within the 3D software, we can then export picture sequences which will give the illusion of
                movement (animation) based on how we manipulate the objects.
                <br>
                What happens in animation is that motion is simulated in a way that the eyes tend to believe that actual
                motion has taken place while the fact is the perceived sense of motion is only because of the
                consecutive images that are passed through very fast. This theory is inherent be it for 3D, 2D or stop
                motion animation.
                In traditional 2D animation, pictures are hand-drawn and every one showing subtle changes from the
                previous.
                When played back sequentially, it creates the illusion of motion. In stop motion animation, real-life
                models
                are moved slightly and filmed. Again, the pictures will create the illusion of motion when played back.
                In
                3D animation, everything is done within the computer and exported from the computer.

            <h2>The difference between 2D and 3D animation</h2>
            <p class="w4">
                The first concept you must grasp is that 3D means 3 dimensional and 2D means 2 dimensional.
                For 2D animation, everything happens on a 2-dimensional platform. Pictures are flat, without depth and
                offer
                only one perspective. Objects and characters are usually drawn without the subtle soft shadows we see in
                real life and colours have few varying shades. In 3D animation, everything happens on a 3-dimensional
                platform. Pictures have depth and offer multiple perspectives just like in real life and have soft
                subtle
                shadows cast on the objects and characters within.
            </p>

            <p class="w5">
                In 2D, characters look cartoonish and unrealistic. In 3D, characters can look cartoonish but realistic
                at
                the same time.
                Picture in 2D and 3D. See the difference?

            <p>
                Another way to think of this is to think in terms of a painting and a sculpture. 2D is a painting, and
                3D is
                a sculpture. 3D introduces “depth perspective,” so we not only see a rectangle (2D) but a CUBE (3D). You
                may
                also want to think of it like being the difference between a photograph of a glass of water (2D) and
                being
                able to reach out and actually pick up the glass of water (3D).
