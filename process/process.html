            <p class="m1">
                Animation workflow or pipeline is a system consisting of people, hardware, and software aligned to work
                in a specific sequential order to do pre-determined tasks in a pre-determined time frame, which will
                lead to a 3D animation product or asset as the final output.

            <h2>What is Pre-Production?</h2>
            <p class="m2">
                Pre-production is the research, designing, and planning phase of the entire 3D project which is
                split
                between two teams: The design team which creates the idea, story, and designs, and the management
                team
                who writes down the production plan (including budgets, teams, and time frames). The better the
                pre-production phase is done, the easier the production stage will be.
                Pre-production consists of the following steps:

            <p class="m1">
                In general, “the process of creating, developing, and communicating ideas which are abstract,
                concrete,
                or visual” is called “idea generation”. It includes “the process of constructing through the idea,
                innovating the concept, developing the process, and bringing the concept to reality”.

            <h3>Story Creation</h3>
            <p class="m2">
                A good story captures the audience’s attention and leaves them wanting more. However, creating a
                good
                story for a 3D animation is not easy; it is in fact the biggest challenge a 3D animation studio
                faces
                when creating a new product, no matter how big or small.
                For an audience to be truly engaged, stories must have certain qualities such as well-developed
                characters, well-designed conflicts, and satisfying conclusions. Building all of these dynamic
                elements
                and weaving them into an original story with the power to hold the audience’s interest through 3D
                animation can take a huge amount of time and energy, but it’s definitely worth it.

            <p class="m1">
                After you come up with a great idea, shape a story and turn it into a script, it’s time for making a
                storyboard. A storyboard is essentially a series of drawings based on the script, which will be used
                as
                a visual guide throughout the rest of the animation production pipeline.

            <h3>Animatic</h3>
            <p class="m2">
                Animatic is simply an animated storyboard with sound. The one thing a storyboard doesn’t do is the
                portrayal of movements and timing. On the other hand, an animatic is a pre-production tool that
                provides
                an exact representation of each shot’s length by timing out the storyboard. It creates a unique
                opportunity to test the overall visual flow and timing of the project and check if the intended
                meaning
                is conveyed or not.

            <h4 class="animatic">Animatic vs Animation</h4>
            <p>
                The artists prepare the animatic by taking the individual images of the storyboard and turning them
                into
                a movie; a rudimentary version of the final 3d or 2d animation. The animatic is created in a minimal
                form but will eventually evolve into the final edit of the animation project.

                It is a significant stage of the journey from the idea to the screen, in both film and animation.
                Yet, a
                lot of people don’t know much about it. Almost every advert or feature film today had an animatic
                before
                production. Most animation studios make sure it is planned and executed well.

                The final look of the project is decided at this stage; including the concept design, character
                design,
                costumes, prop design, and environment. The mood and the concept of designs must be fully conveyed
                here.
                Shape Language is a concept used in art and 3d animation to communicate meaning based on shapes we
                are
                familiar with. When used in character design, shapes can tell a story, show personality, and illicit
                an
                emotional response in the viewer without using any words.

                The production stage is where all previous efforts must pay off and transform into action. At
                this
                stage, visual elements of the 3D animation will be handed out to the designated teams and
                artists.
                Team
                leaders make sure time frames and quality matches those of the determined plan in the
                pre-production
                stage and goes as smoothly as possible. The outcome of this stage shapes the entirety of the 3D
                animation.

            <p>
                Layout in 3D animation is basically a 3D version of the animatic in low res with proxy models. A
                proxy
                model is a basic representation of the final 3D model with the right shape and size, used to
                demonstrate
                the story visually. Proxy models plus basic information such as character movements or directions is
                all
                that’s needed to start the layout process. It is the first step in production, in which the layout
                artists decide what will be on the screen based on the storyboard and/or animatic and instructions
                from
                the director.

                A 3D model is a surface representation of an object created in a 3D environment like 3D software.
                Creating a 3D model is probably the starting point for most animation artists and an essential part
                of
                the 3D animation production pipeline. Modeling requires careful observation, manipulation, and
                correction of 3D objects through different attributes of the software. Mastering this skill needs
                practice in various subject areas such as anatomy.

            <p>

                <b>3D Texturing.</b> Objects created in the 3D modeling component of the 3D pipeline are usually in a
                program’s default
                flat
                gray color. 3D texturing is in fact the art of clothing the 3D models with 2D images. Texture
                artists
                are responsible for applying color and surface attributes to 3D objects. The general objective is to
                make the model’s surface match its concept art design or real-world counterpart.

                For instance, if the model is supposed to represent a brick wall, the task of the texture artist
                would
                be making sure the 3D brick wall shares the same color and surface properties of a real-world brick
                wall
                when rendered.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>3D Rigging.</b> Rigging is also known as skeleton animation, a technique for defining the range of
                action and gestures
                of a
                3D model character. Rigging artists implement this technique by using a series of interconnected bones.
                The
                most crucial point you should consider is that rigging is not a unique feature just for human models;
                you
                can rig any object with an action. The most amazing examples are the galaxy, buildings, or even the
                Pixar
                lamp, which are among the first 3D models of rigged objects.

        <h3>3D Lighting</h3>
        <p>
            3D Lighting is the collection of tools and techniques used to simulate light in a computer-generated
            3D
            environment. 3D Lighting techniques offer a huge amount of flexibility regarding the level of detail
            and
            functionality. They also operate at different levels of complexity. Lighting artists can choose from
            a
            variety of light sources, effects, tools, and techniques that suit their needs.

            Just like photography or filming, the lighting stage of the 3D animation pipeline is all about
            making a
            3D scene or sequence visible in a specific way through setting up different sources of light.
            Lighting
            is especially important in a 3D animation because it must support the story, convey the mood of a
            shot
            and also visually depict the location, time of day, and even the weather convincingly.

            <h3>3D Rendering</h3>
            <p>
                Simply put, 3D rendering is the process of producing an image based on three-dimensional data stored
                on
                a computer. It is much like photographing or filming a virtual 3D scene.

                In the background, the rendering hardware and software have to do a massive amount of mathematical
                calculations in order to translate the 3D scene’s data into images. The entire look of the final
                render
                is therefore determined by the modeling, texturing, shading, lighting, and animation information
                combined together and rendered, pixel by pixel.

                The 3D rendering technology is not limited to the 3D animation industry; it is everywhere: in
                magazines,
                on TV, on book covers, in advertisements, and all over digital media.

            </div>
            <p>
                The definition of compositing originates from photography; meaning combining two or more images to
                make
                a single one. Generally speaking, compositing is the combining of visual elements from separate
                sources
                into one image, in a way it creates the illusion that all those elements are parts of the same
                scene.
                Compositing can include special effects, stage extension, environment creation, blue/green screen
                replacement, etc. In 3D animation, compositing is about combining two or more render passes or
                adding
                layers to create a single image or series of images with predefined properties.

            <p>
                2D VFX is part of the post-production and is tightly tied to other stages of the same phase:
                compositing, color correction, and final rendering; so much that the compositor and 2D visual
                effects
                artists of a project can be the same person.

                2D visual effects are in fact flat simulations of events that originally occur in a
                three-dimensional
                environment. But most of the time there is no need to recreate them in 3D because they only need to
                move
                in the plane of a surface (the screen).

            </div>
            <p>
                Color correction is a vital part of 3D animation post-production in an animation studio and one of
                the
                final stops in the 3D animation pipeline. It utilizes the most powerful tools to adjust the color,
                and
                also the light and contrast of the images; optimizing the scene to establish the desired look.
                The final output of the rendering component of the pipeline can look good already, but color
                correction
                creates an excellent opportunity to make them even better.
